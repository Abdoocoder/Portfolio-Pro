## Deployment

You can deploy this project to any platform that supports Next.js, such as Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase App Hosting.

### General Steps

1.  Push your code to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
2.  Choose a hosting provider and link your repository.
3.  Configure the environment variables in your hosting provider's dashboard. Use the same keys and values from your `.env.local` file. **Do not commit your `.env.local` file to Git.**
4.  The build command is `npm run build` and the output directory is typically `.next`.

### Security Checklist

-   **NEVER** commit `.env.local` or any file with secrets to your Git repository.
-   Use the environment variable management system provided by your hosting service to store secrets.
-   If you accidentally leak a key, rotate it immediately.
-   The `firestore.rules` are configured to be secure, but always review them before deploying to production.
